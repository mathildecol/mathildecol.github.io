abstract: 'Background:  Hundreds of millions of children living in poverty worldwide
  are not reaching their full, developmental potential. Programs to promote nurturing
  and responsive caregiving, such as those in which community health workers (CHWs)
  conduct home visits to support optimal early childhood development (ECD), have been
  effective in small trials, but have not achieved similar success at scale. This
  study will explore two approaches to scale-up: converting a home-visiting model
  to a group-based model; and integrating the ECD curriculum into an existing government
  program. The objectives of the study are to: 1) Measure how the integration of ECD
  activities affects time and task allocation of CHWs and CHW psychosocial wellbeing;
  2) Examine how the integration of ECD activities affects caregiver-child dyad participation
  in standard health and nutrition activities; and 3) Explore how the availability
  of ageappropriate play materials at home affects caregiver-child dyad participation
  rates in a group-based ECD program. Methods:  We will randomize 75 communities in
  rural Madagascar into three arms: 1) [C], which is the status quo (community-based
  health and nutrition program); 2) [T], which is C + ECD group sessions [T]; and
  3) [T +], which is T with the addition of an enhanced play materials package for
  home use. All children between 6–30 months old at the time of the intervention launch
  will be eligible to participate in group activities. The intervention will last
  12 months and is comprised of fortnightly group sessions in which the CHWs provide
  caregiver-child dyads with information relating to ECD; CHWs will also include structured
  time for caregivers to practice the play and child stimulation activities they have
  learned. We will administer monthly surveys to measure CHW time use and task allocation,
  and we will leverage administrative data to measure caregiver-child dyad participation
  in the group sessions.'
