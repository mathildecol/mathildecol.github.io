abstract: 'Abstract  Introduction In low-resource settings, introducing child health
  programs into community services may compete for caregiver time. We analyzed the
  impact of a new early childhood development (ECD) program in rural Madagascar on
  family attendance at other health services and of adding at-home play materials
  on program attendance.   Methods We randomized 75 communities where community health
  workers (CHWs) implement an existing child health and nutrition program (Projet
  d’Amélioration des Résultats Nutritionnels or PARN), the status quo. We offered
  two 6-month cycles of 12 ECD sessions to eligible caregiver-child dyads (6–30 months)
  in 25 sites [T]; we added take-home play materials in Cycle 2 to 25 sites [T+].
  We used differences-in-differences with administrative data to analyze the effect
  of offering ECD sessions on monthly PARN attendance (T+/T vs. C) among age-eligible
  children and the impact of toy boxes/libraries on monthly ECD session attendance
  (T + vs. T). We used random intercept models to analyze characteristics associated
  with program registration.   Results We analyzed data for 9,408 dyads; 30% and 32%
  registered for the program in Cycle 1 and 2 (respectively). On average, CHWs delivered
  11.4 sessions (SD: 1.5). Children from wealthier households who already attended
  PARN sessions were more likely to register, and we found no effect of T or T + on
  PARN attendance. Adding play materials did not affect monthly ECD session attendance.
  Children from more populated sites were less likely to participate in both ECD and
  PARN sessions.   Conclusions Integrating new services for ECD into the health system
  was feasible and did not reduce dyad participation in existing services. Investment
  in health services in more populated areas is needed to provide coverage to all
  eligible children. Novel strategies should be explored to engage the most vulnerable
  children in new and existing health services.   Trial registration AEA Social Science
  Registry (AEARCTR-0004704) on November 15, 2019 (prospective registration) and ClinicalTrials.gov
  (NCT05129696) on November 22, 2021 (retrospective registration).'
